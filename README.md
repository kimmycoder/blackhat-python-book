# Python 3 "Black Hat Python" Source Code

Source code for the book "Black Hat Python" by Justin Seitz. The code has been
 fully converted to Python 3, reformatted to comply with PEP8 standards and refactored to eliminate dependency issues involving the implementation of deprecated libraries.

Although many optimizations could have been implemented in the source code
 presented
throughout the book, the code was left unaltered as much as possible so that
such modifications can be applied by the reader as he sees fit. The code as
it is needs some serious refactoring efforts ranging from docstrings to type
hinting and exception handling, not to mention enhancements like context
 managers, but these issues by themselves may come to benefit the reader if 
 he has the intention of implementing them. It also presents many bugs
 originating from indentation that have been corrected if fatal errors were 
 to be avoided during runtime.
